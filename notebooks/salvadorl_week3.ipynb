on my observations, since the data was successfully retrieved from AWS S3, it would work for cloud storage integration with PySpark to be able to access huge amounts of data. This would be highly significant especially in real-world application where data would need to be fetched from distributed systems.\n","\n","It proved quite efficient in processing the dataset in parallel, benefitting from a distributed computing environment. I think the data partitioned and processed across multiple nodes ensured speed and scale, as that would be challenging to achieve with traditional SQL-based systems that do not inherently support such large-scale distributed processing of data loading.\n","\n","Alongside the whole process, I think that PySpark performed well over SQL-based systems, especially when the data was large in size, as it scaled linearly over the set of distributed nodes. SQL systems, on the otherhand, tend to have complex configurations such as SQL on Hadoop for similar operations.\n","\n","Consequently, I think PySpark support mode advanced operations, such as machine learning, processing in real-time, and some data cleaning. Since SQL can only query and utilize other tools for complex operations.\n","\n","The utilization of PySpark for the generation of basic statistics in big data environment effectively met the objectives set and considerably outperformed traditional approaches based on SQL in terms of scalability, flexibility, and its performance. Meanwhile, SQL works best when dealing with simpler or lower-scale operations, complexity and scale require more advanced tools than SQL, such as PySpark, which is flexible and enough to handle big data at scale.\n","\n","In my perspective, analyzing the overall procedure will demonstrate how PySpark is an effective tool for generating basic statistics in a big data context, bringing clear advantages over traditional SQL when the context of performance, scaling, and handling complex data workflows is considered."],"metadata":{"id":"cycQm04hDRVz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","Therefore, I conclude that, the above procedure can easily achieve the objective of producing basic statistics with big data. In that respect, utilizing PySpark to access and process large data from the cloud and prepare them to be utilized in further stages means the entire environment is like a pipeline that can efficiently handle distributed computing for big data processing and production of basic statistics, not just SQL.\n","\n","As for the hypothesis, I think that SQL is the most common tool for generating basic statistics, in this procedure, it shows that big data analysis could also be accomplished using PySpark, which is yet another factor or influencial alternative to SQL. Hence, I believe that the hypothesis should be reconstructed or likely not satisfied since their generation was possible from other tools meant for distributed data processing and big computations as well, such as PySpark."],"metadata":{"id":"0ytLo0KMEv5-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# *Optional Challenge*\n","\n","As for this part, I attempted the optional challenge to the best of my understanding for the mean and median just to try alongside the procedure:\n","\n","1. **Produce the descriptive statistics of `so2` parameter.**\n","\n","Based on my research, I think the `so2` parameter is like sulfur dioxide in statistics.\n","\n","*   Count: 10\n","*   Mean: 5.75\n","*   Median: 5.45\n","\n","2. **Produce the descriptive statistics of `pm10` parameter.**\n","\n","Based on my research, I think the `pm10` parameter is the Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less in statistics.
